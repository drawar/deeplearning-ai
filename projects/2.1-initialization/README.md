# Coursera deeplearning.ai - Deep Learning Specialization - Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

## Assignment 1: Initialization.

Welcome to the first assignment of the hyper parameters tuning specialization. It is very important that you regularize your model properly because it could dramatically improve your results.

By completing this assignment you will:

- Understand that different regularization methods that could help your model.

- Implement dropout and see it work on data.

- Recognize that a model without regularization gives you a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.

- Understand that you could use both dropout and regularization on your model.
